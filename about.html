            <h2>Why Go Green?</h2>
            <p>Green Diwali is an initiative to reduce the negative environmental impact caused by the festival. From air pollution caused by firecrackers to excessive waste from single-use decorations, we need to change our ways for a cleaner, healthier future.</p>
            <h3>Ways to Celebrate Green Diwali:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1. **Green Firecrackers**: 
                    To reduce air and noise pollution, opt for green firecrackers. These are low-emission firecrackers developed by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in India. Green firecrackers release 30% less particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. They also produce lower noise levels and reduce the negative impact on air quality.</li>
                 
                 <li> 2. **Celebrate with Traditional Diyas**:
                    Instead of using electric lights or decorations that consume excessive electricity, return to the tradition of using clay oil lamps or diyas. Earthen diyas not only save electricity but also support local artisans and potters, providing them with a livelihood. You can make your Diwali brighter without harming the environment by placing these diyas around your home.
                    Opt for natural oils such as mustard or coconut oil to burn in your diyas rather than synthetic oils, which can release harmful fumes when burned.</li>
                
                 <li> 3. **Use Organic Rangoli Colors**:
                    Rangoli is a beautiful way to decorate your home for Diwali, but many synthetic colors contain chemicals that are harmful to both the environment and health. Instead, use natural ingredients like turmeric, rice flour, vermilion, flower petals, and other plant-based dyes to create your colorful designs. This not only protects the environment but also provides a more traditional touch to the festival.</li>
                 
                 <li> 4. **Minimize Plastic Decorations**:
                    Avoid plastic decorations that are not biodegradable and difficult to recycle. Opt for eco-friendly alternatives like paper lanterns, cloth banners, and natural flower garlands. These biodegradable options help reduce the amount of waste generated during the festival and also bring an aesthetic, natural beauty to your home.</li>
