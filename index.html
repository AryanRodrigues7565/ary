            <p>Diwali, the festival of lights, is one of the most widely celebrated festivals in India and among Indian communities across the world. Traditionally, it symbolizes the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. However, in recent years, the environmental impact of Diwali has come under scrutiny due to the extensive use of firecrackers, excessive consumption, and waste generation. As environmental concerns rise globally, there is a growing movement toward celebrating Diwali in a more eco-friendly manner. This guide outlines how you can celebrate a sustainable, eco-friendly Diwali while preserving the joy and essence of the festival.
